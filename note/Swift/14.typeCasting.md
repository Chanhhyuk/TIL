}

class Food: Fruit{
    var region: "korea"
}

let apples = Apple()
let fruits = Fruit()
let foods = Food()

apples is Apple     // true
apples is Fruit     // false
apples is Food      // false

fruits is Apple     // true
fruits is Fruit     // true
fruits is Food      // false

foods is Apple      // true
